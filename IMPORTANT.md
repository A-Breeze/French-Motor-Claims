# Important information
Please consider the points raised in this file whenever interacting with this project. None of the information here is intended to contradict the `LICENCE` of this project. In the event of disagreement, the `LICENCE` takes precedence.

## Purpose
This project is designed for learning purposes only.

## General disclaimer
I have tried to ensure the content presented is clear and correct. However, you should not rely on the content in any way. It is up to you to satisfy yourself that the statements and examples are correct and applicable for your particular purpose.

Do not make or refrain from making any decisions based on the content of this project. There is no guarantee that the content is correct, nor up to date, nor that it is applicable to your circumstances.

## Credits
I have tried to include credits and links where possible to my source material. If you notice any errors, or would like me to take down content that is incorrectly attributed or not for public consumption, please let me know and I will address your concerns as soon as possible.

## Actuarial standards
I am a Fellow of the [Institute and Faculty of Actuaries](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/) ("the Profession") in the UK. This means that I follow the [Actuaries' Code](#https://www.actuaries.org.uk/upholding-standards/standards-and-guidance/actuaries-code) (current version: [v3.0, 18 May 2019](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/Revised%20Actuaries%27%20Code%20FINAL.pdf)) ("the Code") which consists of principles and amplifications "which Members must observe to support the profession in acting in the public interest". In particular, it is possble that some aspects of this project could be considered to be within the scope of the Code, seeing as the Code is applicable in cases where my conduct "could reasonably be considered to reflect upon the profession". It is therefore important to mention that I have tried to follow the Code wherever applicable and possible (but please bear in mind the other disclaimers in this file). 

There are various other [standards and guidance](#https://www.actuaries.org.uk/upholding-standards/standards-and-guidance) which apply to actuarial work. Although I have tried to ensure the content of this project is clear and correct, I do not consider that the content comes within scope of these standards.

## Views expressed
Regarding any of the views expressed in any of the content, they may not be the same as my employer, nor the Profession. Indeed, as this is a project for learning purposes, I expect *my own* views will change over time. 

## Data
This project only uses data that is publically available. None of the data should be personally identifiable nor commercially sensitive. If you spot any mistakes in this regard, please let me know and I will address your concerns as soon as possible. 

## Open source
This project is built as far as possible using free, open source software and tools. If you wish to implement the code in the same way, it is up to you to ensure you run it in the appropriate environment. 

## Work in progress
Using Git version control, users are able to access many versions ("commits") of this project. Any given commits may not be correct or complete. This is the case for any commit in the project's Git repository - there is no particular category of commit (e.g. commits on the `master` branch, tagged commits, etc.) which can be guaranteed to be correct or complete.

## Raising concerns
If you disagree with the above or spot any content which you do not think does not satisfy it, please let me know and I will look to address your concerns as soon as possible.
